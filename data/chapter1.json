    "content": "Scientific study involves facts, theories, and experiments to investigate phenomena based on the scientific method. A 'variable' is defined as a causative factor, characteristic, or trait with a direct or indirect relationship to an event. Example: In a wilted plant, the cause (lack of water/sun) is the causative factor, and the wilting is the effect. The task of a scientist is to establish relationships between these physical quantities.",

Measure extension (start at 4cm). 5. Release and measure distance traveled. 6. Note results. Repeat for extensions of 6cm, 8cm, and 10cm. Mathematical relation: If extension is 'e' and distance is 'x', then x ∝ e.",

Dependent Variable: The factor that changes in response and cannot be predicted directly (e.g., distance covered by the paper bullet). 3. Controlled Variable: Factors kept constant to ensure valid results (e.g., thickness of rubber band, size of paper bullet). Example Table: Tap rotation (Independent) vs. Water flow (Dependent) with Water Pressure (Controlled). Rules: Only one independent and one dependent variable should be used in an experiment.",

Force (mass x acceleration = Newton). 7. Pressure (force/area = Pascal). 8. Work (force x distance = Joule). 9. Power (work/time = Watt). 10. Frequency (1/time = Hz).

Addition/Subtraction Rule: Possible only if quantities have the same fundamental units (e.g., u + v is possible, but s + at is not). Testing Equations: (i) v² = u² + 2as is valid. (ii) s = ut + 1/2 a²t is invalid because units do not match (m ≠ m + m²s⁻³).",
