If the relation is meant to represent an equation for velocity (v) in terms of initial velocity (u), time (t), and some operation, such as addition or multiplication, the appropriate mathematical symbol needs to be used (e.g., v = u + at or v = u * t).",

These may include the type and brand of the dry cell, the type of bulb, the length and material of the wire (except for the thickness), the ambient temperature, and the duration of the experiment.

She decided to mix lime, urea fertilizer, common salt, and compost manure in the soil. Then she brought a bucket of soil from a nearby field and sieved it. She put that soil equally into 12 uniform-sized pots. Then she mixed two spoons of salt in every three pots, two spoons of urea fertilizer in each of the next three pots, two spoons of table salt in each of the next three pots, and finally, two spoons of compost fertilizer in each of the remaining three pots. She then planted similar seeds of the same plant in every pot and placed them all in a sunny place in the house. She watered all the pots every day. After the plants grew, she measured the height of each plant daily and kept a record.\ni. Identify the independent variable, dependent variable and controlled variable in Chandani’s experiment.\nii. Why did Chandani use 3 pots for each experiment?",
    "answer": "Ans: In Chandani’s experiment:\ni. Independent variable:The substances mixed with the soil (lime, urea fertilizer, common salt, compost manure). Chandani intentionally chooses and varies the type of substances mixed in the soil to observe their effects on plant growth. Dependent variable:Plant growth, specifically the height of the plants. Chandani measures the height of each plant daily and records it as an indication of their growth. Controlled variables:Type of plant seeds used, amount of soil in each pot, amount of water provided, exposure to sunlight, size and type of pots, location of pots, and duration of the experiment. By controlling these variables, Chandani aims to isolate and observe the specific effects of the substances mixed with the soil on plant growth.\nii. Why did Chandani use 3 pots for each experiment?\nAns: Chandani uses 3 pots for each experiment to increase the reliability and validity of her results. By having multiple pots for each substance, she can compare the average growth of the plants within each group and observe any consistent trends or patterns. This helps to reduce the impact of random variations or outliers in individual pots, providing a more representative and robust analysis of the effects of different substances on plant growth. Additionally, using multiple pots allows Chandani to account for any differences between the pots themselves, such as variations in soil composition or placement within the experimental setup.",

    "answer": "Ans: The issue with Manisha’s experiment design is that she is testing two independent variables simultaneously (amount of food and time of giving food) without controlling one variable while studying the other. This can lead to confounding variables and difficulty in attributing the observed effects to specific factors. To correct the design of Manisha’s experiment, she should conduct separate experiments, focusing on one variable at a time while keeping the other constant. For example, in one experiment, she can vary the amount of food given to the dog while keeping the time of giving food constant. In another experiment, she can vary the time of giving food while keeping the amount of food constant. This approach will allow her to systematically examine the individual effects of each independent variable on the dog’s eating speed and draw more reliable conclusions.",

The unit of electric resistance, ohm (Ω), is defined as the ratio of voltage (V) to current (A). Mathematically, Ohm’s law states that resistance (R) is equal to voltage divided by current (R = V/I). Let’s break down the units on both sides of the equation:\nOn the left side: Resistance (R) is measured in ohms (Ω).\nOn the right side:\nVoltage (V) is measured in volts (V), which is equivalent to kgm^2s^-3A^-1.\nCurrent (I) is measured in amperes (A).\nNow, let’s substitute the units into Ohm’s law:\nΩ = (kgm^2s^-3A^-1) / A\nSimplifying the equation:\nΩ = kgm^2s^-3A^-2\nTherefore, we have proven that the unit of electric resistance, ohm (Ω), is equivalent to kgm^2s^-3A^-2.",
